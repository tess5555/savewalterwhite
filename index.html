      My dad is amazing. It’s funny, but I didn’t know that until I <br/> 
      found out he was going to die. That it was going to happen<br/>
      soon. That is was real. Then I thought about a lot of stuff.<br/> 
      Things I hadn’t  thought about for a long time. I guess I kind<br/>
      of took him for granted or something. I mean, our parents are<br/>
      just always there. You expect them to always be bugging you <br/>
      to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or <br/>
      try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one <br/>
      day. And make you get up early on the weekend to have <br/>
      “family time” and all that other stuff that used to drive me<br/> 
      crazy. I don’t feel that way now. Everything’s different since <br/>
      Dad got his diagnosis. Since I realized that one day in the<br/> 
      near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.
    </p>
    <p class="p_yellow1">
      Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that <br/>
      question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-<br/>
      sible. One day he won’t be here to ask.    Now I feel lucky when I hear<br/> 
      his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-<br/>
      ing. It means he’s still around. Still my dad.

      My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he’s annoyingly smart. <br/>
      I mean, super brainiac annoying.  He knows the most random stuff.   Like <br/>
      how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.<br/> 
      And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it’s frozen it <br/>
      takes up about 9% more space.   Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt <br/>
      into a totally full glass of water, it won’t overflow. In fact, the water level <br/>
      will go down. He’s always dropping the little facts about everything. He <br/>
      doesn’t realize what a geek he is for doing it, he’s just really into chemistry. <br/>
      I think he really doesn’t understand that not everybody is. He likes to cook <br/>
      because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemi-<br/>
      cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he’s always explaining as he <br/>
      goes. I don’t take his class at school but I hear he’s a pretty good teacher. <br/>
      He gets a lot of practice at home, that’s for sure.
    </p>
    <p class="p_white";"">
      The whole time I’ve been in high school (I’m a sophomore) I’ve always had <br/>
      to hear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr White’s kid. <br/>
      (Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name of the totally loser <br/>
      shoes he always wears). Some kids dissed him just to get on my nerves. <br/>
      Some kids just dissed him period because that’s what you do with teachers. <br/>
      The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their best just like he does, <br/>
      and when you don’t try your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack. That’s <br/>
      how he is at home and at school. I only just figured out what a good qual-<br/>
      ity that is. That’s what makes him brave in his cancer battle and what <br/>
      made me brave, too when I was younger. Whether I wanted to be or not. <br/>
      Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid in high school but because of <br/>
      my dad being a teacher there I was different because. I realize two things now. <br/>
      First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that’s a done deal. <br/>
      And two , he’s the right dad for me.  I can't do a lot of physical stuff be-<br/>
      cause of my disability and that’s okay with my dad and it wouldn’t be with a <br/>
      lot of other dads I’ve met. They’d be disappointed because they’re into <br/>
      sports or whatever. I mean, my dad doesn’t have a disability but you sure <br/>
      wouldn’t want to see him throw a football. So in that way, we get along. It <br/>
      makes sense that he’s my dad and I’m his son. My point is, I don’t care <br/>
      about what the kids at school say anymore. The bottom line is he’s a good <br/>
      teacher and no one can say he doesn’t care about what he does. I know he <br/>
      cares. After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is what he loves the <br/>
      best. I really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what he loves to do <br/>
      for a long time. For him, for his students, and for me and my family.
    </p>
    <p class="p_white";"">
      It’s been a really tough time in our family since my dad got cancer. Not <br/>
      that there’s ever a good time for something as awful and as scary as that, <br/>
      but it was sure a bad time for us. My mom was pregnant with what she calls <br/>
      a surprise baby (who is now Holly and even though she’s a newborn baby she’s <br/>
      actually cute) and my dad had an extra job after school to try to help pay <br/>
      all the regular bills. And that was before he got his diagnosis.  We don’t <br/>
      have a lot of money but we were doing okay until all the medical bills. And<br/>
      my dad is pretty proud - okay, really proud - and doesn’t want to take char-<br/>
      ity. That’s why I’m doing this. Not because I want to make him mad or <br/>
      upset, but because I want him to have a fighting chance no matter what.
    </p>
    <p class="p_white" ;"">
      One thing I don’t understand is why saving someone’s life costs more than a <br/>
      regular person can pay. And why some doctor’s (usually the best ones) don’t <br/>
      take insurance. I think that’s wrong.  I mean, one of the big reasons why <br/>
      my dad didn’t want to get treatment at all in the first place was because he <br/>
      didn’t want to leave us behind with a huge debt. That’s the thing about my <br/>
      dad - he loves us more than anything. More than himself. But we want him <br/>
      around and we want him to try everything he can to stay with us as long as <br/>
      possible. This surgery is the one chance there is to save his life.  And we <br/>
      can’t afford it. And every day that goes by is one less day I’ll have with <br/>
      him. And I don’t want to tell my little sister about my dad.  I want her to <br/>
      know him for herself.
